Here we describe the MultiVoltageSource project, a voltage source with 7 channels intended to be used to power up photonic integrated circuits. It is based on negative linear regulators LT3090 and digital potentiometers AD5290 controlled by an Arduino Nano. It offers 7 channels ranging -0.2 V to -10.2 V.
